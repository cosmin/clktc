<h5>Not designed for cramming</h5>
<p>Typical URL shortners try to compact a longer URL into the least
amount of characters. This is great for squeezing into 140 characters,
but less than ideal for human consumption.</p>

<div class="span7">
<h5>Easy to remember</h5>
<p><em>clk.tc</em> is designed to turn long and hard to remember URLs
into short, descriptive and memorable URLs. You will therefore have to
supply a nice and short name for your URL.</p>
